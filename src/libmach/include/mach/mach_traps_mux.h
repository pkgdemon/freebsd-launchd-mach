/*
 * mach/mach_traps_mux.h — multiplexer ABI for Mach kernel traps.
 *
 * Background. FreeBSD's syscalls.master reserves exactly 10 lkmnosys
 * slots (210-219) for KLD-allocated syscalls. freebsd-launchd-mach
 * fills all 10 with the foundational Mach trap surface; the eventual
 * launchd+configd+notifyd+asl port wants 20-30 more Mach traps. To
 * fit them without patching the FreeBSD base kernel, we route all
 * NEW Mach traps through a single multiplexer syscall: one FreeBSD
 * slot at a claimed RESERVED-range index (currently slot 91), with
 * an op-number selecting which Mach trap to invoke. Approximates
 * Apple's mach_trap_table architecture one level later in the stack
 * (C handler instead of asm trampoline).
 *
 * Wire contract.
 *   long syscall(MACH_TRAP_MUX_SYSCALL, op, a1, a2, a3, a4, a5);
 *                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  ^^  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 *                resolved via sysctl    op  up to 5 user args
 *
 * libc syscall() carries up to 6 register args on amd64 (rdi-r9).
 * The op-number uses one; the remaining five are passed through to
 * the underlying Mach trap. Traps needing 6+ args (mach_msg_trap,
 * mach_msg_overwrite_trap) stay in dedicated FreeBSD slots — they
 * don't go through the multiplexer.
 *
 * Op-number stability. Op numbers are stable across releases (unlike
 * the dynamically-assigned FreeBSD syscall slot). Add new ops at the
 * end; never renumber.

 *   0 — reserved sentinel ("invalid op"); kernel rejects with
 *       KERN_INVALID_ARGUMENT.
 *   1 — host_set_special_port(host, which, port)
 *   2 — task_set_special_port(task, which, port)
 *
 * task_set_special_port migrated into the multiplexer to free its
 * previous dedicated FreeBSD syscall slot for the multiplexer
 * itself (which now occupies that slot — FreeBSD's lkmnosys range
 * is exactly 10 entries at 210-219, all used by foundational
 * Mach traps).
 *
 * New ops append at the end. The traps still in dedicated FreeBSD
 * slots (mach_reply_port, task_self_trap, thread_self_trap,
 * host_self_trap, mach_msg_trap, mach_port_allocate, _deallocate,
 * _insert_right, task_get_special_port) do NOT have op numbers —
 * they keep their dedicated slots for stability and (mach_msg_trap)
 * ABI reasons.
