# /init.sh — boot pivot script.
#
# Phase A target: hand PID 1 to STOCK FreeBSD /sbin/init after the unionfs
# pivot. No launchd yet; that comes post-checkpoint (Phase D). Two modes:
#
# (a) PID 1 mode (kernel exec'd us via shebang):
#     loader.conf init_path=/init.sh causes the kernel to exec us
#     directly via the shebang above. /rescue/sh becomes PID 1 with
#     this script as argv[1]. After the unionfs pivot we hand PID 1
#     to /sbin/init via `exec /rescue/chroot /sysroot /sbin/init`,
#     preserving PID across the exec chain.
#
# (b) Fallback mode (kernel rejected /init.sh, tried /rescue/init next):
#     /rescue/init runs as PID 1 and reads init_script=/init.sh kenv
#     to invoke us as its child. After the unionfs pivot we set
#     init_chroot=/sysroot kenv and exit; /rescue/init does the chroot
#     and continues normal multi-user boot.
#
# Detection: $$ == 1 iff PID 1 mode.
#
# Memory cost: ~50 MB at idle (decompressed pages of accessed uzip data
# only). Writable upper is tmpfs, page-allocated on demand, no fixed
# size — apparent free space scales with host RAM.

# When running as PID 1 (kernel exec'd us via shebang), kernel hands us
# fds 0/1/2 closed and /dev/console isn't accessible until devfs is
# mounted. Set both up before anything else: stdout silenced (clean
# boot console), stderr to /dev/console so any failure is still visible.
# Use absolute paths because PATH is not yet set.
